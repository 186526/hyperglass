Implemented validation, seems to work.
Disabled Scrapli for Juniper, need to figure out WTF is going on there, possibly remove.

- [x] Query result labels are broken
- [ ] `KeyError: 'device_name'` when raising a device connection error
- [ ] Fix VRF/query group label in UI
- [ ] Selecting multiple sites without overlapping query groups marks the field with a red outline, but no error
