Starting in version 2.0, hyperglass supports custom plugins. There are two main types of plugins:

- **Input Plugins**: Apply custom validation logic to or transform user input before the query is sent to a device.
- **Output Plugins**: Interact with the output from a device before it's displayed to the user.

Plugins are associated with a directive.
