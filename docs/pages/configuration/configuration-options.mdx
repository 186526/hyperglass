Once you've gotten started with a basic configuration, you'll probably want to customize the look and feel of hyperglass by changing the logo or color scheme. Fortunately, there are _a lot_ ways to customize hyperglass.

## Configuration File

Create a file called `config.yaml` in `/etc/hyperglass`.
