import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs';

To get started, hyperglass only needs to know about your devices.

<Callout>
  **Devices** are your routers, switches, or whatever else you want to call the endpoints hyperglass
  will query for information.
</Callout>

## Simple Device Configuration

Create a file called `devices.yaml` in the directory `/etc/hyperglass`.

```yaml filename="devices.yaml"
devices:
  - name: NYC Router 1
    address: <IP address hyperglass will use to log into the router>
    credential:
      username: <Username hyperglass will use to log into the router>
      password: <Password hyperglass will use to log into the router>
    platform: cisco_ios
```

That's it!
