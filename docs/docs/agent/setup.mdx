:::caution Time & NTP
Before you get too far, check to make sure your hyperglass server and hyperglass-agent system are both properly synchronized with an NTP server. During the setup process and on every interaction, hyperglass and hyperglass agent exchange [JWT](https://jwt.io/) tokens with a relatively short window (60 seconds, by default) in which to validate the payload. If the system clock on either system is askew by too much, this exchange can fail.
:::

## Setup

To automatically create an application directory, generate SSL certificates, generate and symlink a systemd file, and generate a random secret, run:

```shell-session
$ hyperglass-agent setup
```

If SSL is enabled (which is the default), take note of the secret key â€” you'll use this in the `password` for this device in hyperglass.

:::note
You can also run the setup wizard with certain options disabled, if needed:

```shell-session
$ hyperglass-agent setup --help
Usage: hyperglass-agent setup [OPTIONS]

  Run the setup wizard

Options:
  --config / --no-config    Don't regenerate config file
  --certs / --no-certs      Don't regenerate certificates
  --systemd / --no-systemd  Don't generate a systemd file
  --force                   Force regeneration of config file
  -h, --help                Show this message and exit.
```
