```

## Setup Wizard

To start the setup wizard, run `hyperglass setup`.

You'll receive the following prompts:

### Installation Directory

```shell-session
[?] Choose a directory for hyperglass: /Users/ml/hyperglass
 > /home/user/hyperglass
   /etc/hyperglass
```

hyperglass requires a directory on your system to store configuration files, the web UI, logos, etc. You may choose between the current user's home directory or `/etc`.

## UI Build

After running the setup, the `build-ui` command needs to be run for the first time. This command creates the required file structure for the UI, initializes frontend dependencies, and generates favicons.

:::note
If your system's compute resources are too low, the `build-ui` step will likely fail. See the [system requirements](production.mdx) section for more information.
:::

```shell-session
$ hyperglass build-ui
✅ Completed UI build in development mode
```

## Startup

To start hyperglass at the console run `hyperglass start`.

:::important
hyperglass won't start without a `devices.yaml` file. See the [Adding Devices](adding-devices.mdx) section for instructions on how add devices.
:::

```shell-session
$ hyperglass start
```

:::tip Production
Remember to check the [Production](production.mdx) section for instructions on how to run hyperglass in production. It includes instructions and examples for setting up a Reverse Proxy (such as NGINX or Caddy), and running hyperglass as a system service with systemd.
