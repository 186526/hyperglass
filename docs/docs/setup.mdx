## Setup Wizard

To start the setup wizard, run `hyperglass setup` and you'll receive the following prompts:

### Installation Directory

```shell-session
[?] Choose a directory for hyperglass: /Users/ml/hyperglass
 > /home/user/hyperglass
   /etc/hyperglass
```

hyperglass requires a directory on your system to store configuration files, the web UI, logos, etc. You may choose between the current user's home directory or `/etc`.

### Configuration files

```shell-session
Do you want to install example configuration files? (This is non-destructive) [y/N]:
```

hyperglass can install example configuration files to your hyperglass installation directory to make it a little easier to get up and running.

### Systemd Service

```shell-session
Do you want to generate a systemd service file? [y/N]:
```

hyperglass also includes a [systemd](https://systemd.io/) service file, which can be installed if you use systemd. If selected, a systemd service file will be generated and copied to the installation directory. Then, it will be symlinked to `/etc/systemd/system`. All you need to do to enable the service is run:

```shell-session
$ sudo systemctl enable hyperglass
```

## UI Build

hyperglass is build with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), a [React](https://reactjs.org/)-based UI framework that supports server-side rendering and static exporting, which contribute to hyperglass's speed and SEO-friendliness. At startup, hyperglass creates a new "UI build", which is a static export of the site and includes some elements of the [configuration](parameters).

It is recommended to run an initial UI build after running the setup wizard, so that you can verify that the installation is working prior to diving into configuration.

```shell-session
$ hyperglass build-ui
✅ Completed UI build in production mode
```

The UI build will run automatically any time the hyperglass configuration or version changes.
