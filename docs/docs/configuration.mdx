hyperglass is meant to be _extremely_ customizable, but with reasonable defaults that most operators won't need to override. Even though there are a _lot_ of configuration options, all of them can be left untouched and hyperglass will work (although, it's recommended to at least set the organization name).

<Admonition type="tip" iconType="emoji" title="Validation">
    On the back end, hyperglass uses strict configuration schema validation, so it's virtually
    impossible to configure hyperglass incorrectly without receiving a contextual warning about
    what's missing or incorrect about a configuration.

# Configuration Files

hyperglass configuration consists of three separate [YAML](https://yaml.org/) configuration files:

-   `hyperglass.yaml`
    -   Defines configuration parameters for the application and UI
        <MiniNote>This file is not required for hyperglass to run</MiniNote>
-   `devices.yaml`
    -   Defines devices (routers), SSH proxy servers, and credentials
        <MiniNote>
            This file <strong>is required</strong> for hyperglass to run
        </MiniNote>
-   `commands.yaml`
    -   Defines commands for custom network operating systems, or overrides default hyperglass command sets.
        <MiniNote>This file is not required for hyperglass to run</MiniNote>

Configuration files may be located in one of the following directories:

-   `/etc/hyperglass`
-   `~/hyperglass`

# Adding Devices

To add, as an example, a Cisco router, add the following to your `devices.yaml`, with the relevant details changed for your device:

```yaml
routers:
    - name: router01.pop01
      address: 10.0.0.1
      network: AS65000
      credential:
          username: username
          password: password
      location: pop01
      display_name: Phoenix, AZ
      port: 22
      nos: cisco_ios
      vrfs:
          - name: default
            ipv4:
                source_address: 192.0.2.1
            ipv6:
                source_address: 2001:db8::1
```

There are a lot more options, but this is enough to get started. For all device configuration options, <Link to="/docs/devices">see here</Link>.

    If you have a lot of devices with shared configuration parameters, you may want to look into{" "}
    <strong>YAML Anchors and Aliases</strong>. If you've never used them before, they can be pretty
    weird looking at first read. Atlassian{" "}
