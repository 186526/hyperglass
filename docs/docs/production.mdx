## Reverse Proxy

You'll want to run hyperglass behind a reverse proxy in production to serve the static files more efficiently and offload SSL. Any reverse proxy should work, but hyperglass has been specifically tested with [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) and [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/). Sample configs for both can be found below.

### Caddy

The following file can be placed anywhere, and referenced at runtime with `sudo caddy run -config <file name>`. The highlighted lines should be replaced with your installation's specific variables.

```text {1,2,4,5,8,11} title="Caddy"
lg.example.com:443 {
	tls person@example.com
	file_server {
            root /etc/hyperglass/static/ui
            index /etc/hyperglass/static/ui/index.html
        }
        file_server /custom {
            root /etc/hyperglass/static/custom
        }
        file_server /images {
            root /etc/hyperglass/static/images
        }
	reverse_proxy localhost:8001
}
```

:::tip
The `tls` directive will tell Caddy to automatically use Let's Encrypt to generate SSL certificates for hyperglass.

### NGINX

The following file can be placed at `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/hyperglass`. It supports IPv6, and will automatically redirect to HTTPS. The highlighted lines should be replaced with your installation's specific variables.

```nginx {4,9,10,17,19} title="NGINX"
server {
  listen 80;
  listen [::]:80;
  server_name lg.example.com;
  return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
server {
  listen [::]:443 ssl ipv6only=on;
  listen 443 ssl;
  ssl_certificate <path to cert chain>
  ssl_certificate_key <path to key>

  client_max_body_size 2M;

  server_name lg.example.com;

  root /etc/hyperglass/static;

  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /ui /ui/$uri =404;
    index /ui/index.html;
  }

  location /openapi.json {
      try_files $uri @proxy_to_app;
  }

  location /custom/ {
      try_files $uri $uri/ /custom;
  }

  location /images/ {
      try_files $uri $uri/ /images;
  }

  location /api {
      try_files $uri @proxy_to_app;
  }

  location @proxy_to_app {
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
    proxy_redirect off;
    proxy_pass http://[::1]:8001;
  }

}
```
