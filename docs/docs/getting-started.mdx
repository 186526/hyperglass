## Automatic installation

If your system runs on:

-   Ubuntu Linux
-   ~~CentOS/Red Had Linux~~
-   macOS (requires [homebrew](https://brew.sh))

You should be able to proceed with the automatic installation:

```shell-session
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/checktheroads/hyperglass/v1.0.0/install.sh | sudo bash
```

:::caution Piping to bash
You should be <i>very</i> worried when someone asks you to do what I just did. Downloading a bash script from the internet and piping it to `bash` with root privileges is a terrible idea, unless you fully trust the source. Please don't trust me - go [look at the code](https://github.com/checktheroads/hyperglass/blob/v1.0.0/install.sh) and determine for your self if it's safe to execute. If you feel it's not, please proceed with the manual installation (and [tell me why](https://github.com/checktheroads/hyperglass/issues), so I can fix it).

## Manual Installation

### System Dependencies

#### Python

hyperglass is written in Python 3 and requires Python version 3.6 as a minimum dependency.

If you're confident upgrading your system's version of Python won't break your system (many Linux operating systems rely heavily on Python for package management and other system functions), you can install Python 3.6:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="debian"
  values={[
    { label: 'Debian/Ubuntu', value: 'debian' },
    { label: 'RHEL/CentOS', value: 'rhel' }]}>

<TabItem value="debian">

```shell-session
$ sudo apt install -y python3.6-dev python3-pip redis-server
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="rhel">

```shell-session
$ sudo yum install centos-release-scl python3-devel rh-python36 redis
$ sudo scl enable rh-python36
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

You can then verify your Python 3 version:

```shell-session
$ python3 --version
Python 3.6.9
```

#### Other Dependencies

The hyperglass UI is written in [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/). As such, some Javascript dependencies are required. hyperglass also relies on [Redis](https://redis.io/) for caching purposes.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="debian"
  values={[
    { label: 'Debian/Ubuntu', value: 'debian' },
    { label: 'RHEL/CentOS', value: 'rhel' }]}>

<TabItem value="debian">

```bash
# Add NodeJS Repository
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_13.x | sudo -E bash -

# Add Yarn Package Manager Repository
curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list

# Install
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y nodejs yarn redis-server
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="rhel">

```bash
# Add NodeJS Repository
curl -sL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_13.x | sudo bash -

# Add Yarn Package Manager Repository
curl -sL https://dl.yarnpkg.com/rpm/yarn.repo -o /etc/yum.repos.d/yarn.repo

# Install
sudo yum -y install gcc-c++ make nodejs yarn redis
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::note From the Developer
I've attempted to abstract away most of the Javascript-related configuration and operational steps, because I think I might be the only network engineer on the planet who actually doesn't mind JS ðŸ˜‚. If you run into any issues with the NodeJS/Yarn installation processes, don't hesitate to [raise an issue](https://github.com/checktheroads/hyperglass/issues) on Github, and I'll do my best to help out.
