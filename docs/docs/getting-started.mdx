# Download & Install

## System Dependencies

### Python
hyperglass is written in Python 3 and requires Python version 3.6 as a minimum dependency. If your system has a version of Python older than this, you may want to consider using hyperglass in a virtual environment. For development, hyperglass uses the [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) dependency and virtual environment tool, so it's probably easiest to use Poetry if you need to use a virtual environment.

If you're confident upgrading your system's version of Python won't break your system (many Linux operating systems rely heavily on Python for package management and other system functions), you can install Python 3.6:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="debian"
  values={[
    { label: 'Debian/Ubuntu', value: 'debian' },
    { label: 'RHEL/CentOS', value: 'rhel' }]}>

<TabItem value="debian">

```bash
sudo apt install -y python3.6-dev python3-pip
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="rhel">

```bash
sudo yum install centos-release-scl
sudo yum install rh-python36
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

You can then verify your Python 3 version:

```bash
python3 --version
# Python 3.6.9
```

### Other Dependencies
The hyperglass UI is written in [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/). As such, some Javascript dependencies are required:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="debian"
  values={[
    { label: 'Debian/Ubuntu', value: 'debian' },
    { label: 'RHEL/CentOS', value: 'rhel' }]}>

<TabItem value="debian">

```bash
# Add NodeJS
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_13.x | sudo -E bash -

# Add Yarn Package Manager
curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list

# Install
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y nodejs yarn
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="rhel">

```bash
# Add NodeJS
curl -sL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_13.x | sudo bash -

# Add Yarn Package Manager
curl -sL https://dl.yarnpkg.com/rpm/yarn.repo -o /etc/yum.repos.d/yarn.repo
sudo yum -y install gcc-c++ make nodejs yarn
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

<Admonition type="tip" title="From the developer" iconType="emoji">
I've attempted to abstract away most of the Javascript-related configuration and operational steps, because I think I might be the only network engineer on the planet who actually doesn't mind JS ðŸ˜‚. If you run into any issues with the NodeJS/Yarn installation processes, don't hesitate to <a href="https://github.com/checktheroads/hyperglass/issues">raise an issue</a> on Github, and I'll do my best to help out.
