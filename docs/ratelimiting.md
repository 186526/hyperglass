Hyperglass supports configurable rate limiting of both site loads and queries. By default, users are able to reach the site up to 120 times per minute, and submit up to 5 queries per minute. When the site limit is reached, users are directed to a separate error page until the timer expires. When the query limit is reached, an error message is displayed, and no further queries are allowed until the timer expires.

Hyperglass uses [Flask-Limiter](https://github.com/alisaifee/flask-limiter) to handle application rate limiting. In Flask, the `/lg` route, which is used for actual queries, is associated with the query rate limit, while the default `/` route is associated with the site rate limit. Both of these limits are configurabale in `hyperglass/hyperglass/configs/config.toml`. See [here](/configuration/general/#rate_limit_query) for more information.
